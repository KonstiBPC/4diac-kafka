# Kafka as network layer in 4diac FORTE
This repository is for [ECSA 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/track/ecsa-2022/ecsa-2022-tools---demos) demonstration paper. Here we are implementing Apache Kafka as network layer at [4diac FORTE](https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/en_rte.php). Here we are using [lbrdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) as Apache Kafka C++ client library.
